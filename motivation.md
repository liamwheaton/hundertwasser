It doesn't look so shiny to me. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. In our darkest hour, we can stand erect, with proud upthrust bosoms.

Bender?! You stole the atom. You know, I was God once. You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me!

Oh God, what have I done? You can crush me but you can't crush my spirit! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Tell them I hate them. Bender, hurry! This fuel's expensive! Also, we're dying!
