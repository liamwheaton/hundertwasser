Oh God, what have I done? Michelle, I don't regret this, but I both rue and lament it. Belligerent and numerous. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase. Hello Morbo, how's the family? You'll have all the Slurm you can drink when you're partying with Slurms McKenzie!

I'll get my kit! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Your best is an idiot! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Meh.

My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution. Also dark wizards. I love you, buddy! You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! We don't have a brig. I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense. Daddy Bender, we're hungry.
